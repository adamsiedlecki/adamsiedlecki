### Hi there 👋

Currently my major personal project is **OMS** - Orchard Management System. 🌳🍎🍓

❔ *What is the purpose of this system?*  
📌The goal is to provide orchard's owner with a automated tool that serves and stores data about certain events.

❔ *What events do you mean?*  
📌Events like reaching specific temperature, humidity and opening or closing gates to the orchard.

You can observe my development plans [here, on the public read-only Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOqNl2k0=/?share_link_id=800092555950)
