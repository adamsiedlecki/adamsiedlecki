### Hi there 👋

Currently my major personal project is **OMS** - Orchard Management System. 🌳🍎🍓
 
📌The goal is to provide orchard's owner with a automated tool that serves and stores data about certain events.

You can observe my development plans [here, on the public read-only Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOqNl2k0=/?share_link_id=800092555950)

Components that are present in my repositories:
- OTM - [Orchard Temperature Monitor 🌡️](https://github.com/adamsiedlecki/OTM)
- OBM - [Orchard Broadcast Monitor 📡](https://github.com/adamsiedlecki/OBM)
- ODG - [Orchard Document Generator 📈](https://github.com/adamsiedlecki/ODG)
